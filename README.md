## "Snolab_binned_1" 

This folder contains images corresponding to the hidden (blinded) dataset from the Golden quadrant used in this publication: arxiv. The images are calibrated using the mean value of a single electrÃ³n in ADUs

The images are contained in root files separated by exposure time (in seconds).
Inside the root files there is a tree:

Where X corresponds to the column, Y to the row, ePix to the pixel charge after calibration, and RunID corresponds to the an internal image index. The mask corresponds to a binary code where each bit corresponds to a different mask. "1" indicates that a pixel was masked with the mask in that bit number. For example:

256 + 4 = 260 In binary is: 0000000100000100. Which indicated that the pixel is masked by the Halo and Bleeding cuts.

For the 1e analysis, we implemented this cut to select the unmasked pixels: !(mask&0x967d). 

0x967d = 38525 = 1001011001111101. Which means that active masks are:

* 1 pix cluster cut: if the pixel has a neighbour of >0.5e- (or epix > 0.5e-)
* Bleeding mask: if the pixel may be affected by CTI
* High-energy or Halo mask: if the pixel may be affected by High Energy Events
* Cross-talk: if the pixel may be affected by cross talk
* Noisy row: if the electronic noise in the row too large.
* Edge: if the pixel is near the edge of the CCD
* Bad pixel: if the pixel is in a pixel with an excess of single electron events, as analyzed over a certain dataset
* Bad Column:  if the pixel is in a column with an excess of single electron events, as analyzed over a certain dataset
* Extended bleed mask: does not apply?
* ClusterShape: this doesn't have any impact in the 1-electron analysis since we selec 1 pixel events

Other masks are executed during reconstraction but are either deprecated or not used in the 1-electron analysis.
