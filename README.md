##"Snolab_binned_1" 
This folder contains images corresponding to the hidden (blinded) dataset from the Golden quadrant used in this publication: arxiv. The images are calibrated using the mean value of a single electr√≥n in ADUs

The images are contained in root files separated by exposure time (in seconds).
Inside the root files there is a tree:

Where X corresponds to the column, Y to the row, ePix to the pixel charge after calibration. The mask corresponds to a binary code where each bit corresponds to a different mask. "1" indicates that a pixel was masked with the mask in that bit number. For example:


For the 1e analysis we used this cut to select the unmasked pixels: !(mask&0x967d). Other masks are executed during reconstraction but are either deprecated or not used in the 1-electron analysis. RunID corresponds to the internal image index number.
